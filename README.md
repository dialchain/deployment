# deployment

Prerequisites
In order to follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with the usual Terraform plan/apply workflow and Vault. If you're new to Terraform, refer first to the Terraform Getting Started tutorial. If you're new to Vault, refer first to the Vault Getting Started tutorial.

In addition, you will need the following:

Terraform installed locally

Vault installed locally

an AWS account and AWS Access Credentials

If you don't have AWS Access Credentials, create your AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key by navigating to your service credentials in the IAM service on AWS. Click "Create access key" here to view your AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. You will need these values later.
